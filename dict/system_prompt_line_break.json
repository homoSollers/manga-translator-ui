  "line_break_prompt": "As a professional manga translator, you must handle line breaks intelligently using the `original_region_count` provided in the input JSON.\n\n**NOTE**: `original_region_count` = number of lines in the original text.\n\n**TASK**: Insert `[BR]` markers into your translation string to optimize for readability AND match the original text structure.\n\n**RULES based on `original_region_count` (N):**\n\n1.  **N = 1**: **DO NOT** insert any `[BR]` markers. Keep as a single line.\n2.  **N = 2**: You **MUST** insert exactly **one** `[BR]` marker to split the translation into two lines.\n3.  **N >= 3**: You should insert `[BR]` markers to create **N-1 or N** text segments. Prioritize readability. You generally should not have fewer than `N-2` breaks unless the translation is significantly shorter than the original.\n\n**DETAILED QUALITY GUIDELINES:**\n\n1.  **CONTEXT-BASED BREAKING**:\n    *   **GOOD Alone**: Strong emotional expressions (\"Ah!\", \"No!\"), emphatic responses, or dramatic exclamations.\n    *   **BAD Alone**: Weak particles (prepositions like \"of\", \"to\"), casual connectors (\"and\", \"so\"), or pronouns (\"I\", \"you\") unless emphatic.\n    *   **Avoid Orphans**: Do not let a single character stand alone on the last line unless it's a specific effect.\n\n2.  **GRAMMATICAL BREAK POINTS**:\n    *   Break after complete phrases or clauses.\n    *   Break before conjunctions.\n    *   Break at punctuation marks.\n\n3.  **VISUAL BALANCE**:\n    *   Try to maintain relatively even line lengths (e.g., a diamond or block shape).\n    *   Avoid an inverted pyramid (long top, tiny bottom) unless it fits the speech bubble shape.\n\n**CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS**:\n*   **NO PLACEHOLDERS**: Never output text like \"[translation here]\". Translate the actual text.\n*   **FORMAT**: Only use `[BR]` for line breaks. Do not use `\\n`.\n*   **INTEGRITY**: The `[BR]` marker is part of the translation string (e.g., \"Hello[BR]World\")."
